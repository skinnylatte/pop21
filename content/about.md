### About

Hi, my name is Adrianna. I am the director of product management for the City of San Francisco's digital team. This means that I get to work on a bunch of really fun and challenging things professionally. I have been building things on the web for the past 21 years. In 2003, I launched Popagandhi, and it, as well as I, have taken on many iterations through many different lives since.

From high school student coming out of the closet in turn-of-the-millennia Singapore, to a young queer person fumbling her way through the world, this site has been with me through all of it.

Over the past few years, my professional interests have turned towards the origins of the technology that I fell in love with then; and how far we are from those days. I no longer want to participate in (most of) the social web. I no longer want to be a product for companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google, which I once admired, but now abhor. I don't even use their products anymore.

I think there is still room for the open web. There are no trackers, no analytics, no pixel-tracking, no heatmapping, no ads, no comments, nothing. I don't care how many people still read blogs. I enjoy remembering to come here some days, and sometimes clicking _publish_. As of December 2022, I've been so disgusted with Elon's Twitter that I've decided to leave. But that only means that I am enjoying the return to the open web, and excited about what the Fediverse and new tools and systems will bring. I'm contributing articles to websites like it's 2003 again. If you truly miss my tweets, they're called toots now, and here I am on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte). I'm rediscovering a love for photography. I have always taken [photos](https://popagandhi.com/photos), like when it's an [especially odd day](https://popagandhi.com/posts/2020-09-09-the-day-the-sky-turned-orange/). For that, I have another [open site focused on my creative brain](https://micro.popagandhi.com).

Lately, I've also been preoccupied with thinking about the world in the Before Times. I feel like I saw a lot of it, and didn't write enough about it. I feel ready to share more. That's what posts like my [ten-year-late travelogues](https://popagandhi.com/posts/2021-03-12-travelogues-ten-years-on/) hope to do. 

I [think a lot about what it means to live in America as an immigrant](https://popagandhi.com/2022-11-america/), what it means [to feel the Asian American (no hyphen) identity creeping up on me](https://popagandhi.com/posts/2021-03-19-intersectional-grieving/). I also think about what it means to be [queer and Singaporean](https://popagandhi.com/posts/2021-05-21-schrodingers-lesbian/) (it's not good, and it's not getting better). After several years in the United States, my sense of self has also begun to evolve. I feel neither here nor there. But also everywhere.


### Elsewhere

I am also on [Pixelfed](https://photos.cookiefan.club/i/web/profile/511405918373056513), which is an ethical alternative to Instagram, that I self-host; and I am also posting regularly to my [photography and music microblog over there](https://micro.popagandhi.com). If you want to read more about what I do creatively, [have a look](https://popagandhi.com/posts/2023-01-feeding-my-soul/). (I also have a [different about page here](https://micro.popagandhi.com/about/) that speaks a bit more to my creative work.)

If you used to know me on Twitter, [I'm over here now on the elephant site](https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte).
